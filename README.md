## Tasks:
We aim to learn together and compete in various Machine Learning contests and Hackathons. 
* To achieve so, you will be asigned projects each month which are to be completed (individually/team).
* "Code With us" Sessions to get hands-on development experience building projects with us
* We will share resources in advance for learning and understanding concepts and expect discussions and queries from your side
* Hackathons and contests for sharpening your skills

## How to submit your projects:
1. To begin, fork this repository. This creates a copy of this repository in your github account.
2. Clone the forked repository. Go to code section of your repo and copy the <b><i>HTTPS Link</i></b> in your clipboard. <br>
Execute the following command in <i>Command Prompt</i> or <i>Git Bash</i> in desired loaction to load repository files in your local machine:
```
git clone [HTTPS_Link]
```
3. Open your text editor [VS code/ Sublime/ Visual Studio] and open terminal and run the following command:
```
git branch
```
* This should display "main". <b><i>Never edit files directly in the main branch</i></b>
4. Create a new branch for editing and working upon by executing the following command:
```
git checkout -b [branch_name]
```
5. Complete your details mentioned in the "About You" section [individually] and work upon the alloted projects or projects of your interest [individually/ team]
6. After working on your project files, save all changes and run the following commands:
```
git add --all
```
```
git commit -m [descriptive_message_explaining_your_commited_files]
```
7. Run the following command before pushing your files:
```
git remote -v
```
* <i>Shows streams of repository while working remotely. You should see the following:</i><br>
<b>origin [HTTPS_Link]</b><br>
8. Run the following commands to add stream to original repository [upstream]:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lordsid003/Geek-Room-AI-ML-Department.git
```
```
git pull upstream main
```
* <i>This syncs your current branch with the original repository and ensures, its up to date.</i>
9. Finally, push your files using:
```
git push
```
10. Finally raise your Pull request with proper description and title:
* <b>Example: </b><br>
[Feature]: Worked upon "Housing price prediction" [Month 1 Projects] <br>
<i>Description: </i> Completed Project 3: "Housing Price Prediction" of Month 1 Projects using Linear regression
11. After your PR has been merged, run the following commands:
```
git switch main
```
* <i>Switches to main branch on your local machine</i>
```
git merge [branch_name]
```
You can then delete your branch and sync your repository with the original repository.
